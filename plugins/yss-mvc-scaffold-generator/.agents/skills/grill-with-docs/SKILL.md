description: Use when the user explicitly requests a relentless design interview that must preserve resolved glossary terms, ADR-worthy decisions, and factual research evidence.

Call the Skill tool with `grilling`, then call it separately with `domain-modeling`.

## Output Contract

1. Read the repository identity and current glossary before the first round.
2. Separate discoverable facts from user decisions; investigate facts instead of asking the user.
3. Ask the entire current decision frontier, with a recommendation for every question, then wait.
4. Record resolved stable terms in the authoritative `CONTEXT.md` only when they are true glossary entries.
5. Create an ADR only when the decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and a real trade-off.
6. Persist factual research/validation records in the repository's existing review or research convention.
7. Do not modify implementation skills, contracts, or code until the user confirms shared understanding and the intended change scope.

The final grilling round must list confirmed decisions, unresolved assumptions, documents changed, and the next authorized action. A research note is evidence, not an architecture approval or release claim.
