# Compile modes

Manifest schema is the incremental-compile graph. The agent fills `id`, `kind`, `livePath`, `rawPath`, `role`, `extract` (derived only), `articles`. Scripts fill `sha256`, `compiledAt`, `gitCommit`.

## Manifest

Path: `<wiki-root>/.wiki-manifest.json`

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "wikiRoot": "wiki/example",
  "compiledAt": "ISO-8601",
  "gitCommit": "hex or empty",
  "profile": "mixed",
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "schema.sql",
      "kind": "document",
      "livePath": "apps/.../schema.sql",
      "rawPath": "raw/schema.sql",
      "sha256": "...",
      "role": "copy"
    },
    {
      "id": "skills-lock.json",
      "kind": "derived",
      "livePath": "skills-lock.json",
      "rawPath": "raw/skills-lock-names.md",
      "role": "extract",
      "extract": { "kind": "skill-names" }
    }
  ],
  "articles": [
    {
      "id": "连接器管理",
      "file": "wiki/连接器管理.md",
      "sourceIds": ["schema.sql"],
      "humanOwned": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`profile`: `mixed` (docs + code), `documents`, `code`.

Source kinds:

| kind | raw | when it drifts |
|---|---|---|
| `document` | copy of `livePath` | sync raw, rewrite articles that list this `id` |
| `derived` | extract from `livePath` | re-run extract, rewrite dependents |
| `code-surface` | none (`rawPath` null) | rewrite dependents; do not copy source into raw |

`livePath` is repo-relative. `rawPath` is wiki-root-relative. `file` is wiki-root-relative.

Article id = basename of `file` without `.md`. Renames are explicit `LINK` / `RETIRE`, never a silent refresh side effect.

## Derived extracts

Every `kind: derived` source must set `extract.kind` to one of `skill-names`, `heading-list`, or `prose-note`. Refresh and rebuild re-run that recipe into `rawPath`. Do not copy the live file in full.

Shared rules:

1. Input is `livePath` (or the live files the recipe names).
2. Output is `rawPath` only.
3. Sort or section order must be stable and documented for that kind.
4. The extract must be smaller than the live input and must not include secrets, hashes, or lock metadata unless the recipe says those names are the payload.
5. Replay the same recipe on drift; do not hand-edit raw to "fix" names.

| `extract.kind` | Replay |
|---|---|
| `skill-names` | `extract.mjs skill-names --in <livePath> --out <wiki-root>/<rawPath>`. Lists `skills.shared` and `skills.platform` keys, `localeCompare` sorted. No hashes or paths. |
| `heading-list` | Agent: list headings from the live file in document order, verbatim. No body copy. No script in this skill. |
| `prose-note` | Agent: short labelled note that cites the live inputs. Stable section order. No full-file copy. No script in this skill. |

## init

Done when the target is a detectable Karpathy wiki and lint exits 0.

1. If `wiki/index.md` already exists: ask refresh vs rebuild. Do not init over it.
2. Ask: wiki path, corpus roots, coverage, and body language (follow the host project's document-language rule). See [discover.md](discover.md).
3. Discover corpus with the [discover.md](discover.md) checklist. Do not ingest `docs/` wholesale.
4. Write raw copies/extracts. Write manifest source list. Run `inventory.mjs hash`.
5. Write `wiki/CLAUDE.md` from the template, adapted to this corpus — do not hard-code a previous product name.
6. Write `index.md` categories first, then articles. Categories are index `##` headings.
7. Orchestrator writes hub pages. Other pages go to subagents with disjoint file lists ([writing.md](writing.md)).
8. Lint. Sample live-source facts. Append `log.md` `CREATE`.

## refresh

Done when only drift-hit articles change, human-owned pages are untouched, lint exits 0, and log has a structured `REFRESH`.

1. No manifest → stop. Rebuild, or rebuild the manifest from existing「来源」sections. Do not invent `sourceIds`.
2. `inventory.mjs status` (alias of `drift`) against every `livePath`. Pass each Agent-listed new file as `--candidate <livePath>`. Do not scan the tree. Read the JSON keys `changed`, `missing`, `unchanged`, `articles`, `unmapped`, `humanOwned`. Non-empty `changed` or `missing` is stale. Exit `0` with that JSON is normal, not a failure. Exit `2` is a script error.
3. Impact set = `articles`. Rewrite those pages except `humanOwned` (wikilinks only).
4. For `document` / `derived`: update raw first (derived: re-run `extract`), then rewrite hit articles.
5. Each `unmapped` live path must get one triage: `New` / `Update` / `Disputed` / `No material`. Do not create pages silently. `No material` appends log only.
6. Deleted sources → mark missing in citing articles; do not delete pages silently.
7. Unhit articles: zero bytes changed.
8. Rewrite is not "rewrite the whole wiki and call it refresh".
9. Lint. Sample facts on hit pages. Append `REFRESH` with machine-readable fields:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] REFRESH | <summary>
- changed: <sourceId>, ...
- missing: <sourceId>, ...
- articles: <articleId>, ...
- unmapped: <livePath> (New|Update|Disputed|No material)
```

Omit an empty `changed` / `missing` / `articles` line. Repeat `unmapped` once per candidate. `status` / `drift` never fail just because those arrays are non-empty.

## rebuild

Done when raw matches live, LLM-owned pages are rewritten, stable ids and human-owned pages remain, lint exits 0, and log has `REBUILD`.

1. Rediscover corpus with [discover.md](discover.md). Do not trust the old source list as complete.
2. Recopy / re-extract raw.
3. Keep article ids that still earn a page. Retired ids: `RETIRE` in log, drop from index.
4. `humanOwned: true` (frontmatter or manifest): fix wikilinks only.
5. Rewrite remaining articles. Rebuild index (categories may evolve).
6. Replace manifest via `inventory.mjs hash`.
7. Full lint + sample + `REBUILD`.

rebuild is not `rm -rf wiki`. Stable ids keep old `[[wikilink]]` and external links valid.
